Aggressive data augmentation is a key component of the strong generalization capabilities of Vision Transformer (ViT). We propose "Pyramid Adversarial Training," a strong adversarial augmentation which perturbs images at multiple scales during training. We achieve a new state of the art on ImageNet-C, ImageNet-Rendition, and ImageNet-Sketch using only our augmentation and the standard ViT-B/16 backbone.
