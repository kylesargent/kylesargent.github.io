<i>If the most intelligent
people we know—the "best-educated," to use a current term—were
also the people who make most extensive use of logico-experimental [scientific] principles in social matters to the exclusion of
all other principles, it would be legitimate to conclude that, in course of time, such people would 
reject everything of a non- experimental character; and that other people, more or less their
equals in knowledge, would also be more or less like them in their exclusive acceptance of logico-experimental principles. But the
facts do not stand that way. If theologians have diminished in number among our educated people and lost much of their power,
metaphysicists, properly so called, are still prospering and enjoying fame and influence, to say nothing of those metaphysicists
who call themselves "positivists" or under some other name are merrily overstepping the boundaries of the logico-experimental.
Many scientists who are supremely great in the natural sciences,
where they use logico-experimental principles exclusively or almost so, forget them entirely when they venture into the social sciences.
As regards the masses in the large, what one observes
is an unending alternation of theologies and systems of metaphysics rather than any reduction in the total number of them.</i>

<!-- <i>Many a second-rate fellow gets caught up in some little twitting of the system, and carries it through to warfare. 
He expends his energy in a foolish project. Now you are going to tell me that somebody has to change the system. 
I agree; somebody's has to. Which do you want to be? The person who changes the system or the person who does first-class science? 
Which person is it that you want to be? Be clear, when you fight the system and struggle with it, what you are doing,
how far to go out of amusement, and how much to waste your effort fighting the system. 
My advice is to let somebody else do it and you get on with becoming a first-class scientist. 
Very few of you have the ability to both reform the system and become a first-class scientist.

<i>Velasquez was more than dignified—he was pompous, and something of a martinet in his ideas of discipline, being so tenacious of etiquette that no one, 
    not even the first citizens in the colony, sat uninvited in his presence. Nor had he ever stood in relations of equal comradeship to Cortes, 
    however friendly he may have been; hence it is not to be imagined that he humbled himself to offer a reconciliation, being first rebuffed by his 
    subordinate, and afterwards, when it suited the latter to present himself before him, that he celebrated the resumption of friendly relations with 
    such demonstrations of affection and intimacy as Gomara describes.Yet Diego Velasquez's vast capacity for blundering enabled him even to do this. 
    His desire to explore and conquer by deputy, and to win distinction vicariously, was defeated by the impossibility of finding men 
    possessed of the required ability to undertake successfully such ventures, 
    combined with sufficient docility to surrender to him the glory and profits resulting from them.</i>

<i>
... So what do ascetic ideals mean? In the case of an artist, we have concluded: nothing at all! 
... Or so many things that it is tantamount to nothing! ... Let us put aside artists for the time being: their position in
the world and against the world is far from sufficiently independent for
their changing valuations as such to merit our attention! Down the ages,
they have been the valets of a morality or philosophy or religion: quite
apart from the fact that they were, unfortunately, often the all-too-glib
courtiers of their hangers-on and patrons and sycophants with a nose
for old or indeed up-and-coming forces. At the very least, they always
need a defender, a support, an already established authority: artists
never stand independently, being alone is against their deepest instincts.
So, for example, Richard Wagner took the philosopher Schopenhauer as
his front man, his defender, ‘when the time came’...
